# Strawpoll.me-Bot eb852g62
<br/>Hello there, this is a program I created to automate the action of voting on the website https://strawpoll.me.
<br/>This works for both non-captcha and captcha strawpolls.
<br/>
<br/>Download: https://github.com/bditt/Strawpoll.me-Bot/releases
<br/>
<br/>Dependencies:
<br/>Newtonsoft.Json. This can be installed using nuget.
<br/>
<br/>Instructions:
<br/>If there is no Proxies.txt file, create one and fill it with your proxies.
<br/>To get the poll id, take the number part of the poll url.
<br/>Ex: https://www.strawpoll.me/17089651/ the poll id would be 17089651.
<br/>The choice id can be found by inspect elementing your choice and getting the number at data-option-id.
<br/>Ex: data-option-id="138534203" the choice id would be 138534203.
